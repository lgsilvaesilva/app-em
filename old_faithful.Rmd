Old Faithful is a cone geyser located in Wyoming, in Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Old Faithful was named in 1870 during the Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition and was the first geyser in the park to receive a name. It is also known as one of the most predictable (as indicated by its name) geographical features on Earth, erupting almost every 91 minutes. The geyser, as well as the nearby Old Faithful Inn, is part of the Old Faithful Historic District. By [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful "Title").
